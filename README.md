# SimpleSatLogger
This is an Android based logging program from ham radio satellites. Must be used with the MIT App Inventor
https://appinventor.mit.edu/

This version (1.0) only supports the currently available FM satellites.
- ISS
- SO-50
- AO-91
- PO-101

You must save first before exporting the ADIF file. ADIF files are saved by date so doing multiple logs for the same day will addend exiting logs from that day.
